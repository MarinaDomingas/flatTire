# My bike has a flat tire. Now what?
In order to fix a flat tire, the first thing to do is to make sure that it is parked in a safty area, away from traffic and on a flat surface.

Then, you must check if the tire is really damaged or if it is just empty.

For that, thoroughly inspect the tire and look for any [signs of tears, puctures](https://www.example.com) or for something that might be stuck on it.

If you find none, probably the tire is just empty and in need of being [pumped up](#How-to-pump-up-a-bike-tire).




## How to change a flat bicycle tire

To change a flat tire please follow the below steps:

- [Remove the wheel](#Remove-the-wheel): Release the brakes, then the wheel.

- [Remove the tube](#Remove-the-tube): Deflate the tube completely and remove it by pressing on the bead (edge) of the tire or using a tire lever so you can access the tube.

- [Find the cause of the flat](Find-the-cause-of-the-flat): Inspect the wheel, tire and tube for the location and causes of tears or punctures.

- [Patch or replace the tube](Patch-or-replace-the-tube): When out riding, its better to replace the tube with a new one and fix the damaged one later.

- [Reinstall the wheel](Reinstall-the-wheel): A walk through on the steps for the front and back wheel.



### Remove the wheel


1. Use an upright bike stand to elevate the wheel while you work. If necessary, you can turn the bike upside down to work on it, just remember to remove the panniers and other bags beforehand to prevent scratching them.

2. Disconnect the brakes if they're in the way of taking off the wheel
- if it's rim brakes, you’ll need to release your brakes.
- If it's a v-brake, squeeze the brake arms together to ease the tension so you can release the cable.
- If there is a quick-release lever on the brake, open the lever.

3. Release the wheel from the frame
- Loosen the nuts on the wheel axle with a wrench. 
- Use silicone spray or even cooking spray if the nuts refuse to loosen with a wrench or ratchet alone.
- Some newer bikes have much simpler, quick-release wheel latches — in this case, just open the latch without removing the wheel yet.

4. Pull the chain out of the way if you're removing the back wheel
- You can give the chain more slack by adjusting the gears.
- Shift until the chain is on the outermost gear on the rear wheel and the innermost gear on the pedal spindle.
- Pull back on the rear derailleur (which guides the chain during gear shifts) so that the chain pulls away from the cassette's (gear disc's) cogs.

**Tips:**

- If your bike has disc brakes, be careful not to touch the rotor when opening the quick-release mechanism because it can be hot enough to burn you. Also, avoid getting oil or other contaminants on your disc brakes.
- Practice taking the wheel on befora it is actually needed might be a good idea. That way it will be easier when you actually have to do it by the side of the road.
