# My bike has a flat tire. Now what?

In order to fix a flat tire, the first thing to do is to make sure that it is parked in a safty area, away from traffic and on a flat surface.

Then, you must check if the tire is really damaged or if it is just empty.

For that, thoroughly inspect the tire and look for any [signs of tears, puctures](#Find-the-cause-of-the-flat) or for something that might be stuck on it.

If you find none, probably the tire is just empty and in need of being pumped up.




# How to change a flat bicycle tire

To change a flat tire please follow the below steps:

- [Remove the wheel](#Remove-the-wheel): Release the brakes, then the wheel.

- [Remove the inner tube](#Remove-the-inner-tube): Deflate the tube completely and remove it by pressing on the bead (edge) of the tire or using a tire lever so you can access the tube.

- [Find the cause of the flat](#Find-the-cause-of-the-flat): Inspect the wheel, tire and tube for the location and causes of tears or punctures.

- [Patch or replace the tube?](#Patch-or-replace-the-tube): When out riding, its better to replace the tube with a new one and fix the damaged one later.

- [Reinstall the wheel](#Reinstall-the-wheel): A walk through on the steps for the front and back wheel.



## Remove the wheel


**1. Use an upright bike stand to elevate the wheel while you work**
- If necessary, you can turn the bike upside down to work on it, just remember to remove the panniers and other bags beforehand to prevent scratching them.

**2. Disconnect the brakes if they're in the way of taking off the wheel**
- if it's rim brakes, you’ll need to release your brakes.
- If it's a v-brake, squeeze the brake arms together to ease the tension so you can release the cable.
- If there is a quick-release lever on the brake, open the lever.

**3. Release the wheel from the frameReinstall the wheel**
- Loosen the nuts on the wheel axle with a wrench. 
- Use silicone spray or even cooking spray if the nuts refuse to loosen with a wrench or ratchet alone.
- Some newer bikes have much simpler, quick-release wheel latches — in this case, just open the latch without removing the wheel yet.

**4. Pull the chain out of the way if you're removing the back wheel**
- You can give the chain more slack by adjusting the gears.
- Shift until the chain is on the outermost gear on the rear wheel and the innermost gear on the pedal spindle.
- Pull back on the rear derailleur (which guides the chain during gear shifts) so that the chain pulls away from the cassette's (gear disc's) cogs.

**5. Slide the wheel free from the bike**
- Guide the front wheel's axle — now that the nuts or quick-release are loose — out of the forked slot that holds it to the frame.
- For the rear wheel, carefully guide the wheel down and forward (for an upright bike) past the chain and anything else in the way.
- Keep pulling back on the rear derailleur to move the chain clear of the wheel.

**Tips:**
- If your bike has disc brakes, be careful not to touch the rotor when opening the quick-release mechanism because it can be hot enough to burn you. Also, avoid getting oil or other contaminants on your disc brakes.
- Practice taking the wheel on befora it is actually needed might be a good idea. That way it will be easier when you actually have to do it by the side of the road.

## Remove the inner tube

**1. Deflate the bike tire completely. There are two ways of doing it, depending on the valve**
- If it is a wider Schrader valve (the type most car tires have), press down on the small pin in the center of the tire valve.
- If it is a thinner Presta valve, remove the plastic dust cap, turn the small valve at the top counterclockwise and press down to release air.

**2. Use a tire lever to separate a section of the outer tire and wheel rim**

- When using tire levers, start on the section of your tire opposite the valve (to avoid damaging the valve stem).
- Use the longer end of one tire lever to pry the bead of the tire up and over the edge of the rim
- If you can't unseat the tire with just one lever, place a second lever about two or three spokes to either side of the first. 
- Once a section of the tire bead is free, you should be able to free the rest of the tire bead with your fingers.
- Remove the inflatable tube from beneath the tire by pulling the valve stem out through the rim first (be carefull the rim edges are sharp). The rest of the tube should slide out easily when pulled. 

**Tip:** If you don't have a tire lever, you can do it anyway. It's more difficult to do without a tire lever, but you can unseat the tire bead by pushing the bead edge in toward the center of the rim and working your way around the rim. Then move the bead of the tire up and over the outside edge of the rim. 


## Find the cause of the flat

**1. Check for sharp objects on the underside of the tire tread**
- Run your finger or a cloth around the entire channel in which the bike tube rests when installed. Be careful not to cut yourself, since you might come across a nail or shard of glass. 
- Remove anything that might damage the tube you're about to repair or replace.
- If you find a cut longer than around half a centimeter , replace the tire rather than trying to repair it.

**2. inflate the tube to see if it's punctured**
- Tube damage can be difficult to spot. If you don't see any obvious punctures or blowouts, inflate the tube to check for escaping air.
- To find very small leaks, bring the tube close to your face to feel for air or listen for a hiss, or submerge it in water and look for bubbles.

**Tip:** Even if you can see a puncture right away, check for additional holes or tears.



## Patch or replace the tube?

If you are outside biking and don't want to lose a lot of time, the best option is to replace the tire.
Also, if the damage is too extensive or severe to patch, a patch job failed to hold orthe tube’s valve is damaged, the tire should be replaced.
In ny other case, you can try to patch it.

**To tepair a damaged tube, sand and glue the damaged spot, then affix a repair kit patch**
Patching kits are unexpensive and a great way to repair small problems. They usually contain everything needed to create an effective patch in the field.

**1. Clean and dry the damaged area**

**2. Rough up the surface of the damaged area with sandpaper (to help the glue adhere)

**3. Spread the glue**

**4. Apply the tube patch and hold it in place with pressure**


## Reinstall the wheel

**1. Add enough air to give the tube a basic circular shape and ensure it holds air**

**2. If you completely removed your tire from the rim while fixing your flat, push one edge of the tire inside the rim**

**3. Insert the valve stem into the valve hole on the rim. Check that the valve stem is straight and not at an angle**

**4. Place the rest of the tube inside the tire**

- Once the tire and valve are in place, check along its edges to make sure that the tube is not caught between the rim and the tire bead. This could cause another flat.


**5. Pump up the tube to its full recommended tire pressure**
- Inflate the tire slowly, checking both sides of the rim to make sure that the tire bead stays firmly seated.
- Check the pressure with a tire gauge, since an improperly inflated tire is more likely to get a hole or tear in it.

**6. Put the wheel back on the bike**
Reverse the process you used to remove the wheel from the bike:
- Slide the wheel onto the frame's fork, but avoid the chain or other obstructions.
- Reconnect the brakes, reversing the procedure you used to disconnect them — this will vary by brake type.
- Latch the quick release or tighten the nuts that hold the wheel in place.
