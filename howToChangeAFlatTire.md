# My bike has a flat tire. Now what?
In order to fix a flat tire, the first thing to do is to make sure that it is parked in a safty area, away from traffic and on a flat surface.

Then, you must check if the tire is really damaged or if it is just empty.

For that, thoroughly inspect the tire and look for any [signs of tears, puctures](https://www.example.com) or for something that might be stuck on it.

If you find none, probably the tire is just empty and in need of being [pumped up](#How-to-pump-up-a-bike-tire).
